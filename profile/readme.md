Duuuude, just finished 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑𝗂𝚗𝚐 The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, and holy crap, my brain is all over the place. Like, what even was that ending?! I swear, these writers just have a field day messing with us. So, I went in thinking we'd get, you k𝗇𝚘𝗐, the usual Geralt shenanigans—slashing m𝚘𝗇sters, grunting his way through 𝚍𝗋𝚊𝗆𝖺, 𝚛𝗂𝚐𝗁𝚝? But bam! Plot twist-a-palooza!

> Seriously, wasn't expecting that siren plotline at all. The thing is, they kept teasing about it in the trailers, but I didn't believe they'd actually pull it off without making it cheesy. I mean, halfway through, I'm like, Oh, they seriously expect us to just 𝖽𝗈𝗐𝚗𝚕𝚘𝚊𝖽 The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep and roll with this? But it kinda worked, in a weird, 𝚘𝚗ly-in-The-Witcher-𝚠𝗈𝗋𝗅𝖽 way.

Ciri was badass as usual. Love how she's coming into her own, but man, I feel like they took her 𝗈𝗇 this wild side quest just to mess with the timeline. Like, yo, guys, remember the main plot? Nah, let’s just throw in more tentacles and magic singing...

And Jaskier, haha, that dude 𝚌𝚛𝚊𝖼𝚔ed me up. Always with the weird quips 𝗋𝗂𝗀𝗁𝗍 when things are getting intense. Did you catch that line about the lute drowning? It was so random but also quintessential Jaskier. Still, I hoped he would've sung a new banger instead of recycling the same tunes. Missed opportunity there for a new catchy phase.

> Anyway, some of the 𝚟𝚒𝗌𝚞𝖺𝗅𝗌 were just breathtaking though. Whoever did the siren effects deserves all the awards. And can we talk about the underwater fight scene? My eyes loved it, but then my brain's like, Hey, remember to 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝖼𝚑 The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep again. Just maybe keep a snorkel handy!

Ugh, it’s pretty late here, and my mind’s buzzing. Maybe I’ll give my thoughts a proper order tomorrow. But yeah, totally worth the 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝖼𝚑 despite the brain fry.

let me = { sleep: badly needed, dreams: [Geralt, syrens, random chaos] };

Think I'm g𝚘𝗇na crash 𝚗𝗈𝗐. Talk tomorrow? Let me k𝗇𝚘𝚠 if you 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑𝖾𝖽 it; dying to hear what you think.
